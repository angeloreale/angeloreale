## Hi! I'm Angelo Reale Caldwell von Lehman. 👋🏽 

### I'm a Principal Engineer at Arc.dev 👨‍🏫🛳️ and Founder at DreamPip 💭📈.

With 15+ years in the industry, I've partnered with renowned organizations like United Nations, Uber, Ogilvy, Verisk and MongoDB, among others 🏢.

I did study rocket science 🚀 at Castelldefels School of Telecommunications and Aerospace Engineering. But my ship sailed a while ago.

As a Principal Engineer, I don't just architect elegant solutions and specs, translate business needs, or ensure high code quality; I'm also passionate about mentoring junior colleagues, sharing knowledge across departments, and engaging in critical and strategic roadmap conversations from both a technical and business standpoints.
